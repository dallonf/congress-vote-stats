# congress-vote-stats

This is me messing with the [ProPublica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) and data visualization in general. In particular, I'm interested in the polarization of the United States Congress and seeing just how many votes fall right down party lines.

If you want to mess around with the code yourself, there are two different modules, the backend and frontend. The frontend is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project and the backend is a simple AWS Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/). Both of these will require some configuration to get started, so check out their READMEs.

In the future, I'd like to experiment with aggregating this data to reach more interesting conclusions.
