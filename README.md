# congress-vote-stats

This is me messing with the [ProPublica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) and data visualization in general. In particular, I'm interested in the polarization of the United States Congress and seeing just how many votes fall right along party lines.

This is all very work in progress here! If you want to check it out as is, you'll need a ProPublica API Key. Create a file called `.env.local` with the contents `REACT_APP_PROPUBLICA_API_KEY=[your API key]`. From there, it's a standard [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project.
